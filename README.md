# Eco-GRiD: Unleashing Clean Energy Trading with Blockchain

## Problem Statement and Our Bold Solution

### Our Vision:
We envision a world where energy isn't controlled by centralized grids, where communities and individuals can produce, buy, and sell clean energy directly. To make this vision a reality, we introduce the Eco-GRiD, a peer-to-peer blockchain marketplace.

### Impact:
Conventional energy grids are often inefficient and heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Our innovation seeks to disrupt the energy sector, offering a blockchain-based platform for trading renewable energy. This empowers everyone, from households to communities, to generate and exchange surplus renewable energy, fostering sustainability, reducing emissions, and creating robust energy systems.

### Our Approach:
In response to Verihack's Problem Statement 5, we present an Energy Trading platform that bridges the gap between Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Prosumer-to-Grid (P2G) or Grid-to-Prosumer (G2P) transactions. P2P trading links nations' grids, facilitating cross-border clean energy trading using blockchain technology to ensure transparent, immutable, and secure transactions.

Within national grids, prosumers, including users, substations, and power stations, engage in efficient energy transactions, buying and selling surplus renewable energy. Machine learning algorithms continuously analyze data, predicting demand trends and optimizing renewable resource utilization.

### Assumptions:
Our solution relies on some key assumptions, including stakeholder readiness to adopt blockchain tech, data availability for machine learning predictions, regulatory support for decentralized trading, active prosumer involvement, adequate funding, and ongoing technological advancements.

### VeriDoc API Integration:
Our platform leverages the VeriDoc API for user authorization, document submission, QR code generation, and document verification on the blockchain.

## Key Features:
- Cross-Border P2P Trading
- P2G and G2P Transactions
- Blockchain Trust
- Prosumer Empowerment
- Real-time Monitoring
- Automated Settlements
